Here we provide the source code for the paper "Graph Attention for Automated Audio Captioning" submitted to [IEEE Signal Processing Letter]()

The source code will be released with the paper.

The example of predicted captions is presented at [captions_of_examples.md](captions_of_examples.md), accompanying Figure 2 of the paper "Graph Attention for Automated Audio Captioning". It demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately capture and caption the long-time dependent information.
